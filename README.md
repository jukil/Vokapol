*A simple Polish vocabulary engine*

### Add new vocabulary
The whole dictionary is maintained in one single text file called [/dicts/de-pl.txt](https://github.com/orschiro/Vokapol/blob/master/dicts/de-pl.txt). To add new words simply pull the text file and submit your changes. I assume you know how to collaborate with Git and Github at this stage. If your totally unfamiliar you can still send me a list with your words via email. Preferrably this list uses the same syntax structure than the existing dictionary so that I can add them quickly.

### Go offline
If you intend to use Vokapol offline, all you need to do is to [download](https://github.com/orschiro/Vokapol/zipball/master) and extract the ZIP archive. Then change into that directory and run **python vokapol.py**. This assumes that you know how to install Python and have already installed Python. Finally open a browser and open the URL **http://localhost:8080**.
